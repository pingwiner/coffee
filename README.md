Coffee machine simulator

In software company X, engineers work best when consuming one cup of espresso an hour.  The office espresso machine has a first-come-first-serve queue that applies to everyone, except for certain "super busy" engineers who are prioritized before non-super-busy ones.  Among competing super-busies the first-come-first-serve principle applies again. 
When somebody has ordered a coffee and waiting for his cup, other users have to wait for him even they are super busy. It takes 5 minutes to make a cup of coffee. 
Simulated time goes 60 times faster then real, so 5 simulated minutes is 5 real seconds and simulated hour is 1 real minute.
